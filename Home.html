        <h2>Pokemon Game</h2>
        <p>My first Pokemon game is Pokemon FireRed. I was 8 years old when I first played it. I chose Charmander as my starter Pokemon and I still remember the first time I beat the Elite Four. It was a great experience and I will never forget it.</p>

      <h2>Pokemon Anime</h2>
        <p>I've watched Pokemon anime since I was a kid. I nearly watched every episode of every generation. It's just like I was taking the adventure with Ash. I was really happy to see Ash become the champion last year, but also felt disappointed that he would not be the main character in Pokemon Anime any more.</p>
